# Microsoft Orleans Changelog
All notable end-user facing changes are documented in this file.

### [vNext]
*Here are all the changes in `master` branch, and will be moved to the appropriate release once they are included in a published nuget package.
The idea is to track end-user facing changes as they occur.*

- Sample change. We should start adding items here when we submit PRs

- Bugfix: Memory Storage provider no longer throws NullReferenceException after the grain state is cleared. #1804
- Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator.Build package updated to not add the empty orleans.codegen.cs content file at install time, and instead create it at build time (should be more compatible with NuGet Transitive Restore). #1720
